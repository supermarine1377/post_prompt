Microsoft Corporation (High Switching Costs): Microsoft's economic moat comes from its high switching costs. Many businesses across the globe are built around its software, including Office Suite and Windows. Moving away from these products can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive for businesses.

Intel Corporation (Cost Advantage): Intel's cost advantage comes from its scale and efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing. It's expensive to build a semiconductor plant and the costs of running it efficiently are also high. Intel's size and operational efficiency allow it to spread these costs over a large volume of products, giving it a cost advantage over smaller competitors.

Johnson & Johnson (Intangibles): Johnson & Johnson's intangible assets include its brand name, patents, and regulatory approvals. Its strong brand name commands consumer trust and allows the company to charge premium prices for its products. Its patents protect its innovative products from competition, and its regulatory approvals create a barrier to entry for potential competitors.

Walmart Inc. (Size Advantage): Walmart's size advantage comes from its massive scale. It's the world's largest retailer by revenue, which gives it bargaining power with suppliers to negotiate lower prices, thereby creating a cost advantage. It also has a widespread distribution network, making it difficult for competitors to match its reach.

Visa Inc. (Soft Moats): Visa's soft moat comes from its network effect. The more consumers use Visa, the more valuable it becomes to merchants. And the more merchants accept Visa, the more valuable it is for consumers. This network effect creates a strong barrier to entry for potential competitors.
