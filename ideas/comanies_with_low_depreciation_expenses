I'm an AI language model, and I cannot produce up-to-date financial data. To find specific companies that meet your criteria, you'd need to do your research. However, I can explain some sectors and types of companies that generally have low depreciation expenses relative to their gross profits:

1. Software companies: 

Since the majority of their assets are intangible, their depreciation expenses tend to be lower. 

Examples include Microsoft, Adobe, and Salesforce.

2. Healthcare services: 

Companies that provide healthcare services without owning large, capital-intensive properties or equipment will also have low depreciation expenses.

Examples include UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, and CVS Health.

3. E-commerce and online services: 

Companies without physical retail locations and significant direct inventory can have low depreciation expenses. 

Examples include Amazon, Etsy, and eBay.

4. Financial services: 

Companies that operate mostly in the financial sector generally do not have to rely much on physical assets, reducing their depreciation expenses. 

Examples include Visa, Mastercard, and JPMorgan Chase.

5. Consulting and advisory services: 

Companies that provide consulting, marketing, or other professional services generally have low depreciation costs.

Examples include Accenture, McKinsey & Company, and Boston Consulting Group.

Remember that to find the most recent percentages, researching company financial statements and using financial data platforms like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or Morningstar will reveal the best options for you. Also, note that keeping a diversified and balanced investment portfolio is essential to minimize risks.
